      <p>
        Yet another day where I do absolutly nothing. Well, to be fair I did do some Real analysis and analytic
        number theory, well by "did" I meant I just read 2 pages and left. This lazy-ambitious personality has been
        so wildly demotivating I can't even escape it. I don't know why but whenever I try escaping it, I end up where I began.
        I promise myself I'll do better, but 2 days later there I'm with my unfulfilled promises.

        Loneliness is yet another factor in my life that has been constantly poking me. Maybe god is keeping something for me, and 
        I hope is not a giant middle finger. Speaking of god, Is there even a such thing called "God"? I mean Godel did made a attempt
        to prove it but I've been lingering about it.

      <p>
        It seems to me that expectation is the number one thief of happiness — number two, of course, being comparison.
         You expect something to happen, and it doesn't go accordingly, and then your big fat smiley face turns into a big ugly sad face.
          The disappointment you feel after it is greatly unmeasurable.

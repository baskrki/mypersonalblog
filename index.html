      <h2>June 9, 2025 – Met a guy with Schizophrenia</h2>
      <p>
        I met this dude on discord. He was 39 and he was from Denmark. Oldest person I had ever met on discord. 
        He told me everything, from his high school crush to how some dude picked him up from his work and stranded him to that hospital where he 
        has been stuck for about 4.5 years now. We talked about for 1.5 hour and he told me how he is being forced to take a injection shot every 14 days, which 
        I understand is for his own benefit. He kept taking about his personal development and how he wants to be a better person and work on his social skill.
        He kept saying  '"I'm not schizophrenic but the doctors told me I have it, but I feel normal". He had never had a girlfriend or a wife, he also told me 
        how his mom visits him every week. Honestly, He was happy when I saw him through the camera but I still felt sad for him seeing him isolated in a room.
        He was super generous and humble, I hope he gets well soon.

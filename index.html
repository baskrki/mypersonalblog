      <h2 class="Home-Heading">June 9, 2025 – Met a guy with Schizophrenia</h2>
      <p>
        I met this dude on discord. He was 39 and he was from Denmark. Oldest person I had ever met on discord. 
        He told me everything, from his high school crush to how some dude picked him up from his work and stranded
        him to that hospital where hehas been stuck for about 4.5 years now. We talked about for 1.5 hour and he told
        me how he is being forced to take a injection shot every 14 days, which I understand is for his own benefit. 
        He kept taking about his personal development and how he wants to be a better person and work on his social skill.
        He kept saying "I'm not schizophrenic but the doctors told me I have it, but I feel normal". He had never had a 
        girlfriend or a wife, he also told me how his mom visits him every week. Honestly, He was happy when I saw him 
        through the camera but I still felt sad for him seeing him isolated in a room. He was super generous and humble,
        I hope he gets well soon.

    <h3 class="Home-Heading">July 7, 2025 – Another day </h3>
      <p>
        Just finished the GOD OF WAR franchise (I,II,III,2018, Ragnarok and the DLC) and all of it just absolute fuckery. 
        SPOILER ALERT. The franchise was going smooth, at least for me, untill 2018. First of all, how did the game turn from 
        a Greek mythology based game to Norse mythology game.

        Baldur was a cool character in the game. Dude was a "badassery", and I liked it. His face, voice, atitude, everything was perfect.
        I felt his sorrow through that one single Helheim or whatever cut scene that was. Since, it was Freya's son I thought "alright,
        they're going to reunite and kick Odin's ass SOMEHOW".But Dude just died like a bug. My favorite character in the game 
        and they just kill it like that?? I get that his move to kill Freya was wrong but atleast could have tried convicing. 
        This was the moment when I started hating the game.

        Ragnarok was even worse. Cool intro, almost thought the guy who voice acted Thanos also voice acted Thor but turns out I was 
        wrong. Immediately knew Thor was #2 character in this franchise, but look what they did to him at the end. Freyr another cool 
        dude, but he didn't even get an ending, they just put him as dead. All my favorite characters just slowly went away—one by one. 

        Tyr was the most unexpected plot twist ever. So he hid himself in the broom closet and no one even bothered to check on him. I 
        get that the main characters where busy but sindri was always home. He is protrayed as this germophobe and yet he didn't check his
        tool closet.

        Kratos is one of the character I despise the most. And Freya. The guy who swore himself that he will not go back to being his old self,
        just picks up the blades and goes to Helheim or whatever that place is to bring up the heart. UNDERSTANDABLE BUT why did he have to bring
        trouble upon himself when odin showed up???? He could have just fucking agreed to the Odin's deal but dude just went "No".
        Ares tricked him into killing his family and dude just went on a rampage mode, killing everyone on his path, even the innocents.
        I was thinking this franchise was coming to an end when the shrine predicted he was going to die but turns out that it ain't him but fucking
        odin.This game killed every character I liked, kept every character I disliked and still won the game of the year title. DAMN santa monica studio.

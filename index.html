      <p>
        Lately I’ve been diving into <b>Linear Algebra</b> and <b>Abstract Algebra</b>. For Linear Algebra, I’m working through 
        <i>Sheldon Axler’s</i> book, and for Abstract Algebra, I’m using <i>Dummit and Foote</i>. I’ve been jotting down notes 
        and solving the exercises as I go. I’m thinking of putting everything on GitHub (once I make sure there aren’t any 
        copyright issues). Other than that, life’s been pretty much the same as usual.

      <h2 class="Home-Heading" id="August-23-2025">August 23, 2025 - Linux</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve officially made the switch to Linux! Ever since I first watched that PewDiePie video about Linux, 
        I’ve wanted to try it out for myself—and now I finally can.   
      </p>
      <p>
        Windows has always been a reliable companion, but one major drawback for me was how poorly it handled LaTeX. 
        Most of the time, I had to rely on Overleaf for my projects, but being tied to an internet connection was frustrating.
        I did attempt setting up LaTeX on Windows using VS Code, but the process was a headache—it required WSL and a lot of 
        unnecessary steps. Even after getting it working, my system eventually crashed, forcing me to reinstall Windows
         (thankfully, my digital license saved the day).        
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I’m running Fedora 42, a Linux distro recommended by a friend, and the experience has been smooth and refreshing.
         No extra bloat, no complicated setups—just a clean, minimal, and reliable system. So far, I’m absolutely loving it.
      </p>

      <h2 class="Home-Heading" id="August-1-2025">August 1, 2025 - Hard Work</h2>
      <p>
        Another important lesson in life: hard work doesn’t guarantee success. I remember being told by my teachers to work hard, and I’d achieve my goal. 
        Even I told many of my friends to work hard to achieve their desired academic scores. But now I’m realizing that I was wrong — even if you put all 
        your efforts into getting to your desired goal, you might not be able to achieve it. NOTHING IS GUARANTEED!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Hard work does pay off, but it doesn’t pay off by guaranteeing success. If you work hard in a field, you might not reach where you wanted to reach,
        but when you look back, you’ll have come a long way. Hard work pays off by making you a better person. You might not be the best, but by doing hard work,
        you’ll at least be better than who you were before starting off. And in that process, you might turn out to be lucky and reach your goal.

      <h2 class="Home-Heading" id="July-28-2025">July 28, 2025 - Job Hunt</h2>
      <p>
        I finally decided to do something. I have been looking for a j*b and oh boy this J*B hunting ain't going very smooth.
         Every position seems to require a experince of 1 year, even the entry level j*bs. Guess life ain't always rainbows and flowers I guess.

      <p>
        When you get bad feelings about things not going accordingly as planned, 
        you just imagine the worst that can happen to you and move on from there. It just reduces your anxiety by a lot.

      <h2 class="Home-Heading" id="July-13-2025"> July 13, 2025 - Expectation </h2>
      <p>
        It seems to me that expectation is the number one thief of happiness — number two, of course, being comparison.
         You expect something to happen, and it doesn't go accordingly, and then your big fat smiley face turns into a big ugly sad face.
          The disappointment you feel after it is greatly unmeasurable.

      <p>
        Yet another day where I do absolutely nothing. Well, to be fair, I did do some real analysis and 
        analytic number theory — well, by "did" I meant I just read 2 pages and left. This lazy-ambitious 
        personality has been so wildly demotivating I can't even escape it. I don't know why, but whenever
         I try escaping it, I end up where I began. I promise myself I'll do better, but 2 days later, 
         there I am with my unfulfilled promises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loneliness is yet another factor in my life that has been constantly poking me. Maybe God is keeping 
        something for me, and I hope it's not a giant middle finger. Speaking of God, is there even such a thing 
        called "God"? I mean, Gödel did make an attempt to prove it, but I've been lingering about it.

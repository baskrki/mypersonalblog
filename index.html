      <p>
        When you get bad feelings about things not going accordingly as planned, 
        you just imagine the worst that can happen to you and move on from there. It just reduces your anxiety by a lot.

      <h2 class="Home-Heading" id="July-13-2025"> July 13, 2025 - Expectation </h2>
      <p>
        It seems to me that expectation is the number one thief of happiness — number two, of course, being comparison.
         You expect something to happen, and it doesn't go accordingly, and then your big fat smiley face turns into a big ugly sad face.
          The disappointment you feel after it is greatly unmeasurable.

      <p>
        Yet another day where I do absolutely nothing. Well, to be fair, I did do some real analysis and 
        analytic number theory — well, by "did" I meant I just read 2 pages and left. This lazy-ambitious 
        personality has been so wildly demotivating I can't even escape it. I don't know why, but whenever
         I try escaping it, I end up where I began. I promise myself I'll do better, but 2 days later, 
         there I am with my unfulfilled promises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loneliness is yet another factor in my life that has been constantly poking me. Maybe God is keeping 
        something for me, and I hope it's not a giant middle finger. Speaking of God, is there even such a thing 
        called "God"? I mean, Gödel did make an attempt to prove it, but I've been lingering about it.
